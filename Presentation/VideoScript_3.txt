Given we are dealing with two main categories of data(HEALTH AND STATIC INFORMATION ABOUT COVID)
-- The Data team has Researched on potential APIâ€™s to use (Done and decided on John Hopkinns COVID-19 API)
-- Scripts for data collection were made ready.
-- Collected one summarized data of all countries and another one is the country-wise time-series data around the number of cases, deaths etc.

After having collected these two main datasets, they were cleaned and preprocessed to be further refined onto a granular level.

Two major tasks have been done:

Merging of 4 dataframes (which contain active/confirmed/deceased/recovered cases) so all of the data is available in one dataframe easily.
Adding additional columns on the basis of parent column DATE: ie, Day of the week, week number, month inorder to use them for trend visualizations.
Snapshots of the data were shared with the cloud team for enhanced collaboration.
Two main visualizations have been decided and deployed on Tableau which you'll see further in the ppt.
