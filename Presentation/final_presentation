Document the issues met with lex and the restrictions based on what we set out to achieve 
How to tackle that or how it could be done differently next time:
Cannot link lambda function between inten, cannot call one from  the other unlike in python where functions can be called from other files etc.

Issue tackled for each section of the team and how the restriction affected the intended implementation

PPT SLIDES:

SLIDE 1: Hook for the listener regarding the theme of the project

We wanted to provide a solution to the general public to help cope with the COVID-19 Pandemic. Hence we were inspired to base our Masters project on the topic of COVID-19.
Covid 19 pandemic is a serious issue now
We live in unprecedented times right now where people across the world have been affected due to the pandemic and the world has faced one of the worst economical and financial crisis known in decades. 
HOOK POINT ON SLIDE(i.e, 20million been directly affected on the planet) 


SLIDE 2: Problem Given the pandemic that we plan to address.

Has led to mass hysteria and confusion regarding the graveness of the situation, people are not aware of how badly the situation has affected other parts of the world.

Feeling of unrest and sense of loss where information is being circulated at a very high rate.
Impossible for people to continually be up to date and retrieve the most important as well as reliable information regarding the pandemic
Information is available in many outlets but are in very dense format and is difficult to traverse through leading to the most important info being lost  Which is incovenienty for users who are not able to do so (due to reasons, i.e old, not tech savvy etc)

Scattered info, difficult to traverse through, which takes time

Since info is scattered the important info is lost and overwhelms people to stay away and not be up to date

SLIDE 4: Given our proposed solution how the product helps solve issues that we mentioned: VISION OF OUR PROJECT

THINK ABOUT 4 VERTICALS AND WHAT GOES INTO THEM, how to structure user stories


Chatbot and visualization, script for that slide
The chatbot aims to provide a very user friendly, natural language, accessible platform for users of any type to interact with and get the most important information regarding the pandemic, with the visualization aiding with the impact of information received and improving the overall experience of the application.

User story for world map would look like:
User scenario 1: user from the general public who wishes to learn about the overall situation of the pandemic across different parts of the world.

User scenario 2: Irish user who wishes to get a more in depth and relevant information to their particular country regarding the situation surrounding the pandemic. Information provided is at a greater depth an granularity when compared  to the world wise data
User scenario 3: The most critical information surrounding the pandemic in terms of better equipping the public with condensed version of the

FINAL SCRIPT:
Hello everyone my name is and I’m from Team Rocket. I’ll be taking you through this presentation.
Our project name is Covid-19 interactive visualizer. 
Based on our previous meeting we redefined our project with a clearer objective. We aim to create a system which provides an overview of the situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic at a quick glance.

Given the graveness and potency of the virus, we have noticed that existing platforms aimed at informing the public about the pandemic have been structured in a way which makes it very difficu, which only helps people who know how to traverse websites and access tabs by finding the relevant information, making it a minefield for those who lack the savviness to understand the layout of webpages and be able to open multiple pages and traverse between them.
Hence the two main features of the application are as follows
1st one is a chatbot and the other one is the interactive map which will contain visualizations of the data that is collected and curated.
The chatbot aims to provide a very user friendly, accessible platform for user of any type to interact and get the most important information regarding the pandemic, with the visualization aiding with the impact of information received and improving the overall experience of the application.


Plans for coming week: Based on the overly broad scope we had initially, we have decided to reimagine the application with the scope of information being provided by the chatbot to be initially restricted to ireland.
We aim to achieve the Final version of our product by the end of the month in preparation of user based testing for the first week of july by further breaking down tasks and reach goals into sprints and release versions as seen.












Roles: Each member has been assigned to a team and has a set of defined roles for until the final submission of the application. For each sprint we set a number of tasks that are relevant for each member in that role. The tasks are documented and monitored in detail via sprint plans in jira.

(1:35s)Architecture: The architecture of the application is as described in the image below.

Data plan: This is the outline of our data plan and you can view it by pausing this video.
As seen in the presentation, there are four different data sources, in which one source is for data collection of Ireland and the rest are for the world. The type of data collected from each source are given in the image. Next, this data is pre-processed and data from two different sources are merged as shown in the image.
Github: We are keeping track of the minimum project requirements and that we are adhering to the main requirements before the MVP, by ensuring each member is constantly push-committing the work as and when it is completed. Just to give a jist you can see in the image the different folders we have.
Team management:  As mentioned in the last video, Sumit, aditya and ashwin keep track of members to ensure presence in git and the shared folders and initiate regular morning meetings. Each task is carefully assigned and monitored in jira, git and google drive.
Progress achieved this week: After the review of the we have dedicated this week to refine and restructure our scope and research further into each section.
Front-End team 
Refining the overall structure of the web page with a clean flow and layout. Refine the Web page by researching improved functionality to help better the User experience using different css libraries as well as for making interactive visualizations and making the website responsive. 
FOR the rest of our content we used bootstrap.css with bootstrap.js for additional functionalities
DATA: Apurva,Vishal:
We combined data from various APIs; We scoured the web for COVID-19 API’s or other implementations of centralized world data regarding the pandemic. The data compiled together are of two main types: DYNAMIC and STATIC data. The framework of the data is shown on the following two slides.
Added further apis, to better gather and curate data, including ireland specific data.
DYNAMIC / LIVE DATA
John hopkins:
Two different dataframes have been prepared from the main API, first is the Summary data which gives statistical data for 186 countires.
The Yatko API provides us with extra statistical info for the main case categories of covid including confirmed and death rates.
Further implementations made to retrieve both historical and cumulative information on COVID-19.
Cloud framework:
We gather data from the APIs that are publicly available and store them on the Azure data lake. The Azure Data Factory pipeline stores and triggers scripts at regular intervals to retrieve up to date information. The data from the lake is then transferred to an instance of MySQL DB whose server is hosted on Azure. The data from the MySQL database is connected to Tableau and an instance of Amazon Lex that hosts the chatbot. 
For Django and lex Framework :
Maintainence in Dev Server. 
Deployment Maintainence of Website in AWS Server. chatbot Creation and Lambda Functions with Database Handling creation. worked with RDS and Database Handling on AWS which was later shifted to Azure.	
Also ran basic tests on Amazon LEX to understand the limitations.
Django :
-Django is a open source web framework .
-We used Django as part of team rocket as it easy to scale django framework.
-Django suited to our project as we wanted to keep a single programming language which was python.
Deployed the application from start to finish on an AWS EC2 instance.
 We used kommuncate api wrapper for aws-lex bot for cleaner and easier integration.
Evaluation For the Application.
We monitored the metrics of the bot and were able to find that the bot is able to do speech for 15 sec, no scalability issues as scalability of the lex is handled by AWS. Amazon scales to your needs and does not impose bandwidth constraints. As for our scope the lex can only support US English languages. The Lex metrics also shows us if there are any requests which are missed or the bot cannot answer the user request, such requests are easily monitor those.

Thank you.
