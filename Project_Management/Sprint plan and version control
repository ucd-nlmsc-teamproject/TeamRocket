VERSIONS/MILESTONES:
Planning the release versions of the web application to a finer level for shorter sprints and better team efficiency.

v1.0  (8th June – 15th June’20)
First view of the rough front-end page of the web-page along with main statistical summarized data collected.

v1.1  (16th June – 22nd June’20)
Integration of Django to the front-end and a basic implementation of the Chat-Bot.

v1.2  (24th June – 1st July’20)  Milestone 1 / MVP
Core implementation of the paramount tasks (House the Chat-Bot and prepare the map visualizations) before the interim presentation and subsequent preparation of the report.

After having achieved V1.2 and the delivery of MVP , we aim to further breakdown tasks and reach goals  to design a finalized sprint plan and plan the release versions accordingly.
