Based on the overly broad scope we had initially, we have decided to reimagine the application with the scope of information being provided by the chatbot to be initially restricted to ireland.
We aim to achieve the Final version of our product by the end of the month in preparation of user based testing for the first week of july by further breaking down tasks and reach goals into sprints and release versions as seen.

After having achieved partial V1.2, lacking the integration of the chatbot with the front end pf the application, we aim to further breakdown tasks and reach goals into sprints and release versions. As part of the main non-trivial extension we would like to first refine the scope of the chatbot to being strictly restricted to information regarding Ireland. 

Version 2.0  (7th July â€“ 13th Julyâ€™20)
Reviewing the Lex API and identifying the constraints to develop two-three core intents which will be deployed from start to end. Integration of second API with the existing data.

Tasks: 
Research and cloud support:

Create dummy scripts and trigger them using data factory pipeline and assess their effectiveness in data retrieval and storage

Research about ways to connect the instance of PostgreSQL DB to the front-end web application and test it

Data team:

Automate data retrieval jobs from APIâ€™s using time-based job scheduler to improve system functionality

Research and inclusion of 1-2 more APIâ€™s to ensure minimum project requirement

Integration of all data into summary and historical time-series data 

Front end:

Implement containers for better representation of visualizations

Test implement different visualization tools to identify which works better

Documentation of functionality of the tool of choice for visualization on the web page.

Lex team:

 Review of the Lex API and identifying the constraints 

Connection of bot with the 

develop core intent with lambda functionality which will be deployed from start to end
