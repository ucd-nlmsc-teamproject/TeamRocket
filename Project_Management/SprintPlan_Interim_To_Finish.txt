Based on the overly broad scope we had initially, we have decided to reimagine the application with the scope of information being provided by the chatbot to be initially restricted to ireland.
We aim to achieve the Final version of our product by the end of the month in preparation of user based testing for the first week of july by further breaking down tasks and reach goals into sprints and release versions as seen.

After having achieved partial V1.2, lacking the integration of the chatbot with the front end pf the application, we aim to further breakdown tasks and reach goals into sprints and release versions. As part of the main non-trivial extension we would like to first refine the scope of the chatbot to being strictly restricted to information regarding Ireland.
