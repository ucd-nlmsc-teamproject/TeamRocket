DATA MANAGEMENT DOCUMENT 
(Progress since June 1st week until now..)
DATA TEAM : Apurva Deore, Vishal Padma
Initial research was done on various APIs such as below,
1. Johns Hopkins COVID-19 : Majorly using (https://api.covid19api.com/summary)
2. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control: COVID-19 (https://data.gov.ie/)
3. Tweets from Twitter  (if required) 
4. Yatko API - (https://www.programmableweb.com/api/yatko-coronavirus-map-rest-api-v10https://api.quarantine.country/api/v1/summary/latest)
5. Bing covid 19 data from github (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Bing-COVID-19-Data/master/data/Bing-COVID19-Data.csv)

Considering that we need the data that’d answer statistical and theoretical questions asked to the Chatbot; we further divided the data into two broad sections.

I) Statistics of COVID-19 cases (total, currently active, recovered, deceased, tests done) [real time data required, updates happen regularly] -> LIVE DATA
II) Data already loaded in (symptoms of COVID-19, healthy habits to be followed, whom to contact for testing related situations...) [stored-and-forgotten scenario, doesn’t need updates] -> OLD DATA


DYNAMIC / LIVE DATA
Statistics of COVID-19 cases Per Country [Real Time Data, Updating regularly]
-Total cases
-Active cases
-Recovered cases
-Deceased cases
-Tests done
https://api.covid19api.com/summary
https://api.covid19api.com/countries


STATIC DATA
Data already loaded in and doesn’t need frequent updates.
-Symptoms of COVID-19?
-Healthy habits to be followed? 
-Whom to contact for testing related situations (some helpline numbers)


Dataset 1: John Hopkins
After having studied above APIs, currently we’ve narrowed down on the John Hopkinns API, for the reasons below:
It has all the data that is required for us to work on, ie. A lot of information about the statistics of MANY countries to start with.
It gives the information specific to countries starting from the month of January until the latest updated date, ie. If we’re getting the data for the date 16th June, we’d get the data updated until 15th June. So basically, it provides us with real time data! This could be useful when we’re plotting visualizations for various countries (to show trends that the cases follow) 
We’ve already  collected raw data pertaining to the total cases, recovered cases and deaths for about 186 countries as of now.
We’ve also collected the time series data pertaining to the same 186 countries (for each day until today, starting from 22nd Jan, until the most recent updation date of data collection)
There were some data discrepancies, where the data was not recorded or recorded as wrong. To handle this we have replaced the statistics of the previous date wherever required and in some cases the active cases for each country were recorded falsely. So we calculated the active cases on a given date(where it was recorded falsely) by subtracting the death cases and recovered cases from confirmed cases. 

Dataset 2: Yatko Data
After analyzing the data from Yatko API, we have discovered the below mentioned details about the data:
Firstly the data is a summary data which we found in Yatko API, where there are a total of 224 countries.
There are several columns in this data and most of them are similar to the john hopkins data.
The additional columns like, Death ratio, recovery ratio and tested cases in a particular country are also present in this data.
As of now we have two API which give summary for different countries but both have some different columns, so we decided to integrate both the datasets of summary and create a single dataset which will contain all the data from both the API’s.
So we have integrated the summary data for 186 countries from both the API and the final merged Dataset set has below mentioned columns for each country which will be later used in the visualization.
CountryCode
Country
Date
NewConfirmed
NewDeaths
NewRecovered
TotalConfirmed
TotalDeaths
TotalRecovered
Death_Ratio
Recovery_Ratio
Total_Cases_Tested

Dataset 3: Bing Covid 19 Data
The 3rd data which we will be looking into is the data from bing 19 covid data and here the data is collected from many different sources and the same is converted to time series data. This data records data like Confirmed cases,  deaths cases and recovered cases. Data is recorded when the first case is seen in that particular country. It also records the data for each date and for some countries the data is recorded for each date for each state/province. But some countries don't have data recorded according to the state/province. One interesting thing is that this API also records data for the whole world for each date.
As of now we have extracted the data from the API and saved into datasets  and the next we are trying to convert the data in the format of what we have for the John Hopkins data. The idea of this is to, make sure when we we have any data discrepancies in the john hopkins data, we can refer to this data and fill the missing or bad data into john hopkins from this data to maintain and fill the gap in the datasets which will be used by the chatbot or the world map.
Pre-processing Part:
Apart from this real time data, we look forward to collecting static data (which requires no updation) pertaining to the symptoms of COVID, healthy habits and so on. 
We’d also be getting information from some additional APIs and integrating the required datasets to enhance the availability of data from various APIs to be put in one place.
Pre_processing:
We need the summary data to be clean enough in the matter of Timestamp and other elements.
We have dropped only one column from the summary data which is slug. This column was used to country names in the end of the api to collect data. 
Next is the country data which we collected. This data has many columns which were null so they were dropped.
The next thing was to convert the data into time series data.
