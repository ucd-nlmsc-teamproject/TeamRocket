Cloud Architecture
Comparison between Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure.
For the list of resources in the scope of this project, we believe AWS is more suited compared to Azure due to the following reasons:
1. AWS has a cheaper data storage cost in data lakes and databases compared to Azure
2. AWS subscription is cheaper compared to Azure and charges on an hourly basis compared to a minute basis by Azure
3. The number of free credits available for Amazon student subscription is higher
4. The Amazon Lex API is much more advanced in terms of functionality compared to the Microsoft Bot on Azure
5. AWS also lets us connect to DialogFlow whereas Azure does not have that option
Resources used in AWS for the project:
Amazon S3 - To store raw data and pre-processed data
AWS Data Pipeline – To transfer data from a source to destination
Amazon RDS – To store data in relational tables
Amazon Lex(Alternative to DialogFlow)  -To train and build the chatbot
