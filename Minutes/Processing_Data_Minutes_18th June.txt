Google Meet
19th June,20

4 - 5 pm (Apurva, Vishal, Ashwin)

Discussion started on the two types of main data under consideration for further visualization
-Summarized (1 dataframe having the statistical data) (This is perfect and done, no further changes required)
-Time Series (in this, there are 4 different dfs corresponding to Active cases, deaths, confirmed cases and recovered cases)
Visualization mainly to be in the form of trends/graphs showing how gradually COVID-19 spread over the various months in countries.

Discussed about merging the stats data of Active, Confirmed, Recovered and Death cases (for the time series dataframe; since that would be useful in plotting all the data easily).
That is, combining (4 different dataframes , mentioned above) for better visualizations. 

Discussed about having additional columns that'd segragate dates on a much more granular level,
That is, separate the Date into corresponding Day of the week and month (year over here is not essential)


Met on TeamViewer
6pm - 10pm (Apurva, Vishal)

PART-1: 

Pre-processing completed; ie, merging of the 4 dataframes as discussed in the earlier call.
Created a separate column to store the Country and another column that'd store the (Active, Confirmed, Recovered and deaths for every country)
So for every country A, there would be 4 rows dedicated to the Country A

eg, Country Afghanistan : Confirmed
    Country Afghanistan : Active
    Country Afghanistan : Deaths
    Country Afghanistan : Recovered

So when we'd be referring to the cases in particular, we'd use two keys (Country name with the cases column) to identify the same.

PART-2:

Raw Data
Added additional columns to separate the date into the respective DAY of the week and MONTH of the year. (Didn't consider the month, it's constant: 2020).
Used the Calendar package for the same.
Additional columns added separately for each country's records.
