18/06/2020-Cloud and Deployment.
Sumit and Ashwin met for Cloud set up for AWS.

Ashwin applied for the student account.
We looked up on the sample services documents like S3,EC2,
We discussed on  the documentation available on aws portal.
We discussed how data can be pushed onto s3 from external sources.
Ashwin once he has the acess will look into the AWS console and try to create a pipeline
He will also deploy all the necessary resources to the pipeline.

If there are any challenge we will meet again to figure out how we should proceed.
