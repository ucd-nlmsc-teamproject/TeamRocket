
Data to be considered when using the above APIs
-Statistics of COVID-19 cases (total, currently active, recovered, deceased, tests done) [real time data required, updates happen regularly] -> LIVE DATA
-Data already loaded in (symptoms of COVID-19, healthy habits to be followed, whom to contact for testing related situations...) [stored-and-forgotten scenario, doesn’t need updates] -> OLD DATA

COVID-19 APIs in consideration
•	Johns Hopkins COVID-19 
Majorly using https://api.covid19api.com/summary
•	European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control: COVID-19
•	https://data.gov.ie/
•	Tweets from Twitter  (if required)

Data Collection and required filtering/cleaning/pre-processing
-Data Collection from various APIs
	-considering the above mentioned APIs (focus: Johns Hopkins, data wrt Ireland)
-Data Cleaning/Pre-processing
	-Removing stop-words where necessary?
	-missing values if present? (mostly there won’t be any for the statistics part though, just in case of no countries with no cases at all I guess) 

Visualizations to be decided on : 
Map visualizations, bar/ trends per country?
Research and find out about ways this can be implemented in Tableau

Presentations
Weekly stuff (that’s been done) to be updated, on mondays!
Should be 5min videos explaining every bit that’s done and also future plans
