Minutes of meeting: Minaz and Aditya: 11th june
1:30

Break down of the features in detail for the design and functionality of the web page.

Work on segments as whole 

Upon access have a fade in intro to the website 
•	The intro informs the user what the website entails
•	Skip intro option.
•	First time user feasibility for removing the intro sequence

14:20: FEATURES: 
MAIN WEB PAGE
•	Logo on top left, with the web page title as a static in the header.
•	Chatbot which will be minimised at the bottom right
•	Chatbot will always be on the bottom right of the screen
•	The map will be housed in the entire mid section box of the page in a way if the chatbot is maximised it would overlap the map rather than the map resizing itself again
•	To better implement user interaction with the map while having the chatbot expanded, implement a better map interaction tools where the buttons would either be resized or relocated based upon what is being blocked upon the expansion of the chatbot.
•	Bottom of the page below the map we will list the top 6 countries with the most active cases and show stats accordingly
•	The titles of the countries for which the stats are being displayed will be intractable so that the map changes view and shows other related stats for that country.
•	When the user interacts with the map, i.e clicks on a country for further details, the web page refreshes to the more detailed information view of that country.
•	The navigation tabs will be housed inside a dropdown box, within a burger button style icon on the top right corner, like in grammarly.
	 
	
•	Make the web page responsive based on the types of devices being used and for their respect screen resolutions


Chatbot will be minimized with the map in the background

Web page design and breakdown:
•	The header title should stay same as the tabs are changed or page is refreshed 
•	Scroll down Aspect to the main web page to scroll from the map to the stats of the countries down below
•	Have navigation tabs for information data and sub sections
•	Symptoms
•	Preventions 
•	Helpline numbers - check if there is centralised data for retrieving emergency contact numbers. For further help
•	Frequently Asked Questions
•	These sub sections for the information tab will be all housed in a different page seperate from the main web page containing the map and chatbot.
•	Something of the sorts like the image below
