https://api.covid19api.com/total/country

a. Country Name
b. Country Code
c. Confirmed Cases
d. Recovered Cases
e. Death Cases
f. Active Cases

Yatko:
This API provides with data similar to the one provided by Johns Hopkinns but it provides aditional information like the tests done, death ratio, recovery ratio, critical cases. The Yatko API and Johns Hopkinns data was merged to provide an enhanced dataset to be used to fetch worldwide statistical information at one go.
The merged dataframe consists of the following columns:

a. CountryCode
b. Country
c. Date
d. NewConfirmed
e. NewDeaths
f. NewRecovered
g. TotalConfirmed
h. TotalDeaths
i. TotalRecovered
j. Death_Ratio
k. Recovery_Ratio
l. Total_Cases_Tested
m. Critical Cases

Bing:
This API gives us the data for different countries where the data is historical. In this dataset, the data is recorded the day the coubtry has seen its case to current data and the data provided is mentioned below:
a. Country Name
b. Coubtry Code
c. Confirmed Cases
d. Recovered Cases
e. Death Cases
f. Active Cases


Ireland data:

This data source provides us with the data focused on Ireland only. It provides the statistical data for Ireland’s 26 counties separately as well as for the country as a whole.

Pre-Processing:
1. The date formats were made same for all the data recieved from three different sources. 
2. The data was converted in a different format before we can use it to convert it in the final form. Unnecessary columns and data was dropped and gaps were filled by integrating the data from different sources.
3. Later once the data is in the correct format with proper data, converted it in the time series format so that this data can be used by the lex to answer the queries by the user.
4. Some more formatting was done with the data in order to visualize the data.
